# TalkShop Example

This example demonstrates how to use NLAD to build a conversational interface for local businesses. TalkShop allows customers to interact naturally with businesses, browse menus, place orders, and maintain conversation context across interactions.

## Files

- `product_overview.md`: Defines TalkShop's core features and requirements
- `preferred_technologies.md`: Specifies the technology stack and architectural choices
- `mcp_details.md`: Provides context about the Model Context Protocol for memory features
- `available_mcp_servers.md`: Lists available MCP servers that can be utilized

## How to Use This Example

1. Study the structure and content of each file
2. Use them as templates for your own NLAD projects
3. Note how technical details and newer technologies are thoroughly documented
4. Observe how requirements are expressed in natural language
