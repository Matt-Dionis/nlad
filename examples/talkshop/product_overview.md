I would like to leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in building an application that I call "TalkShop." This application will allow customers/prospective customers to interact conversationally with local businesses. I aim to begin by supporting local restaurants. My idea is to scrape their business information (location, hours, full menu, additional information, social media links, images, etc.) from their website. If possible, it would be even better to get the menu information from the GrubHub and/or Doordash APIs. If this is possible, it would be incredible to build GrubHub and/or Doordash orders through natural language conversations and allow customers to submit orders from our application.

Here is an example: a customer opens our application and conversationally states that they are interested in local sandwich shops. The LLM agent suggests several restaurants including "New England Roast Beef" (NERB). The customer asks to talk to NERB. The customer can now conversationally interact with this restaurant. The customer states that they have a party of eight with 3 vegetarians and 1 vegan as well as 2 children in the party. They would look to dine inside the restaurant and would like to know the optimal time to avoid big crowds. The LLM agent suggests a time and asks follow-up questions about the party's desired types of sandwiches. Utilizing knowledge about the vegetarians, vegans, and children in the party as well as answers to follow-up questions, the LLM agent, NERB in this case, builds a full order. This order is presented in a User Interface (UI) that allows the user to interact with simple clicks. This is a nice deterministic UI in an otherwise fairly probabilistic application due to LLM interactions. Once finalized, the user can submit their order so it is ready when they arrive.

The LLM leverages a memory feature to rememeber this customer's order and incorporates it into long-term memory that persists user preferences and updates them as they evolve. The goal is for the user to feel that each local business they interact with remembers them and improves their unique experience with the business over time by leveraging memory. This memory can also be utilized in a broad sense so that businesses can identify trends and spot potential issues across all customers over time.
